## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ☑ UI/UX Overhaul

**Enhancement Description**: Complete visual redesign of the MomNextDoor website to create a more professional, psychologically appealing, and trustworthy appearance for Domina's startup caregiving business.

**Impact Assessment**: ☑ Moderate Impact (some existing code changes) - CSS and visual assets will be substantially modified while maintaining existing functionality and HTML structure.

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Create a professional, credible appearance for Domina's new caregiving business
• Build trust and legitimacy for her startup in the special needs care space
• Generate quality leads through improved visual appeal and clear contact information
• Showcase her services (community leisure respite, disability resources, FCSD, PDD)
• Position her as the go-to special needs care provider in Edmonton

### Background Context
Domina recently started MomNextDoor as a special needs caregiving business serving Edmonton. As a new startup, she needs a professional website that establishes credibility and attracts clients who will contact her directly. The current generic appearance doesn't convey the professionalism needed for parents to trust her with their special needs children. The redesign will create a polished, trustworthy visual identity that generates leads while keeping the simple contact-based business model.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: Website displays Domina's contact information prominently (phone: 780-904-1463)
**FR2**: Services are clearly listed and described (community leisure respite, disability resources, FCSD, PDD)
**FR3**: Professional appearance establishes business credibility
**FR4**: "About Domina" section highlights her parent-to-parent understanding
**FR5**: Clear call-to-action buttons direct users to call for inquiries
**FR6**: Service area (Edmonton & surrounding) is prominently displayed

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Website maintains mobile responsiveness across all devices
**NFR2**: Visual design conveys professionalism and trustworthiness
**NFR3**: Page load times remain under 3 seconds
**NFR4**: Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) are maintained

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing functionality remains intact during visual redesign
**CR2**: Current modular CSS architecture is preserved
**CR3**: Mobile-first responsive design approach continues

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
The visual redesign will build upon the existing modular CSS architecture, leveraging the current component-based system while upgrading visual elements. New design elements will utilize the established CSS custom properties system and maintain compatibility with the existing responsive breakpoint structure.

### Modified/New Screens and Views
- **Hero Section**: Enhanced visual hierarchy and professional imagery
- **Services Section**: Clear presentation of community leisure respite, disability resources, FCSD, PDD services
- **About Section**: Professional presentation of Domina's qualifications and parent-to-parent approach
- **Contact Section**: Prominent display of contact information and call-to-action

- Preserve mobile-first responsive behavior
- Keep consistent interaction patterns for existing functionality
- Ensure visual cohesion between redesigned sections

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Integration Risks**: Low risk as no new integrations required
**Deployment Risks**: Very low risk with GitHub Pages static hosting

## Epic and Story Structure
