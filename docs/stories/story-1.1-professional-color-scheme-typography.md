## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **CSS Architecture**: Modular CSS system with variables.css, components.css, sections.css
- **Current Color System**: Green-based theme defined in css/variables.css

### Testing Standards
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Device Testing**: Mobile (iOS/Android), tablet, desktop testing required
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation using tools
- **Performance Testing**: Load time verification to maintain <3s target
