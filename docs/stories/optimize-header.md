**ID**: optimize-header
**Created**: 2025-01-26
**Priority**: High
**Status**: In Progress

## Story
As a user, I want a simplified header that focuses on booking appointments rather than phone calls, with a clean, mobile-responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove phone number display from header
- [ ] Add prominent "Book Now" CTA button in header
- [ ] Ensure logo is clickable and links to homepage
- [ ] Mobile hamburger menu for navigation (if needed)
- [ ] Sticky header on scroll for easy access to booking
- [ ] Consistent header across all pages
- [ ] Proper contrast and readability
- [ ] Minimal height to maximize content area
- [ ] Fast loading without layout shift

## Dev Notes
- Current header has phone number prominently displayed - remove this
- Replace with booking-focused CTA
- Consider adding subtle animation on scroll
- Keep it minimalistic and professional
- Ensure header works with both light and dark backgrounds

## Tasks
- [ ] Remove phone number components from header
- [ ] Add "Book Now" CTA button
- [ ] Implement sticky header behavior
- [ ] Optimize for mobile (hamburger menu if nav items exist)
- [ ] Test across all pages
- [ ] Update deploy directory

## Testing
- Test sticky behavior on scroll
- Verify booking button works on all pages
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Ensure no layout shift on load
- Test on actual devices
